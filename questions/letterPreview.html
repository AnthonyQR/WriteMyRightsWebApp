            Dear XYZ Superior, <br><br>
            
            I appreciated my time spent at XYZ Corp. While I respect that fact that my layoff was not personal, I do feel that I am not being 
            treated fairly and have not been offered the compensation that I am entitled to under the circumstances. <br><br>

            There was nothing to indicate, leading up to my dismissal, that there were any issues with my performance. My layoff was an abrupt 
            shock to an otherwise excellent working relationship. <br><br>
            Given the circumstances, and in the interest of putting this behind us, I would be willing to accept <br>
        </p>
        <p class="letterPreviewText" id="blurText">
            When I joined the company XYZ years/months ago as a a XYZ Title, I looked forward to being an impactful team member. Since XYZ Date, 
            I was a reliable and diligent employee at XYZ Corp. I truly embodied our company`s inclusive and professional culture. With X years of 
            experience in my field, I brought a wealth of knowledge and skill to XYZ Corp. <br><br>
            Please respond by X date and indicate your acceptance of this offer. Otherwise, I may be forced to pursue more formal legal action. <br><br> 
            Sincerely, <br><br> John Doe 
        </p>
